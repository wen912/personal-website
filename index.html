										<p>My name is Wendy Cheng. I'm a freshman major in the department of Management Information Systems.I came from Taichung and the senior high school I studied in was Taichung Girls senior high school.tcgsIn fact, I've been studying in whole girl's schools for six years, which is to be honest a very special experience that most people won't been through in their life.I like to watch videos and listen to music on my leisure time. I really enjoy chocolate and snacks like Taiwanese popcorn chicken.popcorn chickenMy favorite drink is sweetened white gourd tea white gourd teaand Tieguanyin milk tea.Tieguanyin milk tea I also like children a lot, especially those who aged from 1 to 2.babyFurthermore, I'm the only child in my family, so I'm really looking forward to make some friends in my university school life.Then, the club that I participate in senior high school was the model United Nations.Although I'm not quite fond of it at the moment,for some reasons, it really did broaden my horizons and enhance my English abilities as well.As for my future, I still not really quite sure whether I’m leading my path in the right way or not.Nevertheless, I would definitely try hard to figure who I am, and what I really should be.“Be the change you want to see in the world.” is my motto since junior high school,I wish I could keep up with it and be a better man.</p>

										<h2 class="major">doggy</h2>
										<p>The domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris when considered a subspecies of the wolf or Canis familiaris when considered a distinct species)is a member of the genus Canis (canines), which forms part of the wolf-like canids, and is the most widely abundant terrestrial carnivore.
										The dog and the extant gray wolf are sister taxa as modern wolves are not closely related to the wolves that were first domesticated, which implies that the direct ancestor of the dog is extinct.
										The dog was the first species to be domesticated and has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.
										Their long association with humans has led dogs to be uniquely attuned to human behaviorand they are able to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canid species.Dogs vary widely in shape, size and colors.They perform many roles for humans, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and military, companionship and, more recently, aiding disabled people and therapeutic roles.
										This influence on human society has given them the sobriquet of "man's best friend".</p>

										<h2 class="major">cat</h2>
										<p>The cat (Felis catus) is a small carnivorous mammal.[1][2] It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from wild members of the family.[4] The cat is either a house cat or a farm cat, which are pets, or a feral cat, which ranges freely and avoids human contact.[5] House cats are valued by humans for companionship and for their ability to hunt rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.[6]</p>
